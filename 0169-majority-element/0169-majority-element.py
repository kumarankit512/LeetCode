        # Boyerâ€“Moore Majority Vote Algorithm: We keep track of a candidate element (temp) and a counter. As we iterate through the array:
        #If the counter is 0, set the current element as the new candidate.
        #If the current element matches the candidate, increment the counter; otherwise, decrement it. At the end, the candidate is the majority element.

            if count == 0:
                temp = num
            if num == temp:
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
