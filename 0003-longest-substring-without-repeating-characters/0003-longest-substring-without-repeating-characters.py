        1) Initialize 
            - Initialize two pointers; left and right
            - Create a set charSet to store the unique characters currently in the window
            - Initialize max_len = 0 to track the longest substring found
        2) While right is less than the length of s
            - Check if s[right] (the current character) is already in charSet
            - If it is, that means the current substring contains a duplicate
        3) While the current character s[right] is in charSet:
            - Remove s[left] from charSet to shrink the window from the left
            - Increment left by 1 to move the left boundary rightward
        4) Add the Current Character
            - Add s[right] to charSet (now itâ€™s guaranteed to be unique in the window)
        5) Update the Maximum Length
            - Compute the current window length as right - left + 1
            - Update max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
        6) Move the Right Pointer
            - Increment right to expand the window and check the next character
        7) Return the Result
            - After the loop ends, return max_len
