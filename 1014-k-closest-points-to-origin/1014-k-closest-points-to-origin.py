        '''
        Given:
        1) Array of 'points'
        2) points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the x-y plane
        3) interger 'k' 
        4) The distance between two points is "Euclidean distance" which is âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2)

        Procedure:
        - Given an array of points we have to find a point 'k' which is closest to the origin (0, 0). The distance between X-Y is Euclidean distance.
